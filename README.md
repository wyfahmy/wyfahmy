I always get stuck when I try to write an intro about myself. If for some reason you're readying this, then you want to know something about me. Well, let's do it:

In short, I gravitate towards anything that needs fixing. Let that be a device, a workflow, a relationship, or a business. I like to observe, analyse, think, try, itirate. I love to talk to people, but I'm an introvert. 

Currently I'm the CEO of two businesses, an innovation and experience design firm (webkeyz.com), and a premium corporte training company (gotonexus.com). 

I'm 46 years old, I've been writing code since I was 11 but as a hobby, not as a profession. I wrote games in Basic, Action Script 3. I wrote some assembly, some JS and C! 

I just landed here cuz my LG TV doesn't natively support wallpaper gallery, so I thought of writing a small web app that does so :)

My experince is in Design and Innovation. I also know onething or two about business.

see you around,
WY
